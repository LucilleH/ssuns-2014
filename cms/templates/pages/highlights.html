<h3>GENERAL ASSEMBLIES</h3>
<p>General Assemblies make up one of the five principal organs of the United Nations and serve as the principal deliberative body of the United Nations. These large-scale committees offer delegates the opportunity to engage in a breadth of topics that demand the participation of a diverse body of representatives. SSUNS 2013 will be simulating three General Assemblies that will cover a wide range of topics appropriate for both first time and experienced delegates. The First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly – Disarmament and International Security (DISEC) is an excellent and exciting committee for delegates to get acquainted with rules of procedure while discussing matters of security. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) leads international efforts to eliminate world hunger while also promoting modern agricultural, forestry, and fishery practices. SSUNS 2013 will also be hosting a special General Assembly this year: a modern day simulation of the World Summit for Children. This committee is based on the summit that took place in 1990, and will convene to discuss the issues facing the children of the world today and potential solutions to those problems.</p>

<h3>ECONOMIC & SOCIAL COUNCILS</h3>
<p>SSUNS 2013 will also feature four Economic and Social Councils that will span a wide variety of subjects. For the first time, SSUNS will be simulating a peace conference in the form of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAoC). The committee was started in 2005 by the governments of Spain and Turkey with the goal of reducing tensions between the Middle East and the West by encouraging discussions on education, racial integration, migration, youth, and the media. The African Union (AU) will take a look at the current situation in Africa today, and will discuss topics ranging from development, economics, and health in hopes of finding ways of aiding the progress of this continent. A problem that has become highly publicized is the issue of online privacy and piracy, with governmental programs such as SOPA and CISPA potentially threatening the freedom of Internet users. It is issues such as this that the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) will be discussing. Delegates interested in social development will have the opportunity to participate in the Commission for Social Development and will have the opportunity to discuss the protection of rights of the aboriginals, elderly, and differently abled.</p>

<h3>SPECIALIZED AGENCIES</h3>
<p>Specialized Agencies are committees that give delegates with varied interests a chance to participate in debate as well. SSUNS 2013 will allow delegates to manage different American football teams through the National Football League (NFL) committee. Delegates will discuss rule changes for the protection of athletes and will choose a venue for the next Super Bowl while dealing with issues within their respective teams. The Organization of American States (OAS) will bring together members of North and South America as they discuss the issues of insurgencies, weapons and drug trade, and economic policies. For those interested in medical ethics and biomedical science, SSUNS is offering the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA), where delegates will represent different European medical agencies and will discuss topics such as euthanasia, medical tourism, and stem cell research. For those interested in social development, there is the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF) where delegates will choose charities and NGOs to receive UN funding in an effort to spread democracy throughout the world. On the historical side we have the Meeting of the Emirs, where delegates will portray leaders of the different emirates and will convene to discuss the creation of the UAE, although history may not necessarily replay itself, depending on the decisions and debate of the delegates. SSUNS will also have a 2008 meeting of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, where members of the top 12 North American automobile companies will discuss the issues facing them at the height of the economic meltdown. SSUNS will also feature a historical bilingual committee for its Francophone delegates. This year, we will be simulating the Tunisian Uprising, where delegates will play members of the Tunisian government trying to quell their people from breaking into riots. Lastly, SSUNS will be running a futuristic specialized agency known as the Newspaper Revolution. Set in the year 2020, the Newspaper Revolution will be a meeting of different newspaper companies and media outlets coming together to discuss the future of print media.</p>

<h3>CRISES</h3>
<p>The structure of Crises has been revamped this year to provide delegates with more joint committees to participate in. The Joint War of 1812 will take a look at the British North American and American interactions that ended up solidifying the border that today boasts as being the longest undefended border in history. Delegates will have the opportunity to rearrange the North American map based on how effectively they utilize the resources available to them. Delegates will also have the opportunity to participate in the Joint Korean War, and is sure to be an excellent occasion for delegates to learn about history’s forgotten war. The committee will be especially relevant given the instability in the region today. The UNSC will make its return to SSUNS as a platform for delegates to discuss the hazards facing the international community today, as will Ad Hoc, where delegates will be tested on their creativity, general knowledge, and ability to think on their feet. For those interested in ancient history, SSUNS 2013 will be offering the Punic Wars, the famous series of wars between Ancient Rome and Carthage. Delegates will have the opportunity to either subdue Carthage with force or use acts of diplomacy to create alliances with their fabled enemies. Lastly, the literary committee comes back to SSUNS in a new format in the form of Robin Hood. Delegates will be placed in the legendary Sherwood Forest as they interact with Robin Hood, the man behind numerous ballads. </p>
