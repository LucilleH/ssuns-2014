<p><b>SSUNS 2014 registration fees consist of 2 components:</b><p/>
<ul>
<p>1)	"Delegation Fee" - Non-Refundable delegation fee </p>
<p>2)	"Total Delegate Fee" - Number of Delegates x Fee Per Delegate </p>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the non-refundable delegation fee is one single fee paid per delegation while the total fee per delegate is the cost per delegate applied to each delegate attending SSUNS 2014. The costs for SSUNS 2014 are listed in the table below:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="firstrow"></td>
		<td class="firstrow">Early Registration</td>
		<td class="firstrow">Regular Registration</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1) Delegation fee</td>
		<td>CAD $85.00<br />USA $85.00</td>
		<td>CAD $90.00<br />USA $90.00</td>

		<td>2) Fee per delegate</td>
		<td>CAD $85.00<br />USA $85.00</td>
		<td>CAD $90.00<br />USA $90.00</td>

<p>Therefore the total cost of registration is as follows:</p>
<ul><i>Registration Fee=Delegation Fee + (Number of Delegates × Fee per Delegate)</i></ul>
<p><b>Forms of Payment</b></p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b> Please be aware that due to unforeseen circumstances with Canada Post, SSUNS will not be able to check the PO Box 55 address for registration payments at this time. To all schools that have already submitted payments to SSUNS at the PO Box address, please be assured that your payments will be checked and processed, and that your position on the priority list will be secured so long as the postage date for all payments is before the payment deadline indicated. We simply cannot guarantee that payments already submitted to the PO Box will be updated immediately. For schools yet to complete their payments and for future registrations, please direct all payments to the address at McTavish Street listed above. We apologize for any inconvenience. </p>

<br />
<p><b><i>2) PayPal </i></b> Should you decide to pay via PayPal, you must check the ”Pay using PayPal” option on your registration form.

Delegations choosing to use PayPal are responsible for covering this cost.
