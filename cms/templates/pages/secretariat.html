		<h3>Secretary-General</h3>
		<p><a href="mailto:sg@ssuns.org">sg@ssuns.org</a></p>
		<p>Returning to the secretariat for his third and final time as this year’s Secretary-General, Nikhil Garg. No one seems to embody his own words, “SSUNS is a lifestyle,” better than himself. In addition to eating, sleeping, and breathing SSUNS, Nikhil finds the time to pursue a joint honours degree in Economics and Finance. Well-travelled, adventurous, and always seeking a new challenge, Nikhil has ventured to destinations as exotic as Cape Town and Vietnam, and has lived in India, Indonesia, and the Netherlands prior to settling in Montreal. With years of Model UN experience under his belt, Nikhil is determined to lead this year’s secretariat in taking SSUNS to new and unprecedented heights. (Both figuratively and literally – he summited Mt. Kilimanjaro in seven days.) What draws Nikhil back to SSUNS, year after year, you may ask? His interactions with you – delegates and staff – are what he finds to be the most rewarding aspect of all of the diligent work that he puts into this conference!

		<h3>Chargé d'Affaires</h3>
		<p><a href="mailto:schools@ssuns.org">schools@ssuns.org</a></p>
		<p>Serena Wang is a U2 Physiology student with a minor in International Relations, but she hopes to enter the Interdisciplinary Immunology Program in her future studies. Although she was born in Milan, Serena grew up in Mississauga, Ontario where she got her first Model UN opportunity as a delegate to SSUNS in the 9th grade. Since then, she is now at her 7th SSUNS - not to mention her participation at McMUN, her attendance at numerous conferences in the States, and even her creation of a middle school conference at her high school. Serena is involved in numerous other organisations, and even has her ARCT in piano, but Model UN is one of her greatest passions. Her other great passions include travel – she took her first trip when she was 1 month old and has since travelled the Silk Road, eaten antelope jerky abroad, and even been smuggled onto a train by a chicken-wielding ticket seller! Serena hopes to spread her love of Model UN this year, and knows SSUNS 2013 will be bigger and better than ever!

		<p><a href="mailto:natasha.pr@ssuns.org">pr@ssuns.org</a></p>
		<p>This year’s Director of Public Relations is the bubbly, Shelby Levesque, who hails from Niagara Fall, Ontario. Shelby is in her second year at McGill studying a degree in Economics and Middle East Studies. Though her own experiences as a delegate may be limited, she has been actively involved in all aspects of Model UN at McGill since her first year. With an outgoing and free-spirited personality, Shelby’s wealth of experiences in public relations gives her the skills and knowledge to expand publicity and sponsorship for SSUNS 2013 to a whole new level. She will be traveling to Guatemala and Lebanon this upcoming summer where she will be working at a refugee camp. Outside the world of SSUNS, Shelby spends her days crafting and devising a way to meet Oprah and become her new Gayle. Nevertheless, her devotion to SSUNS is immeasurable, because above all, SSUNS is her family.

		<p>Even though this is her first year doing MUN, Arun’s bold personality proves that she is ready to take risks and dive in headfirst. With plenty of experience in the limelight as a talented Bharatnatyam dancer and in past debating and case study competitions, she is a born performer ready to deliver. Arun is not a fan of the cold weather, but her tea addiction and ability to talk nonstop about pretty much anything keep her and her bubbly personality warm. When not studying for her Finance major, Arun can be found listening to Jazz or reading. She is also passionate about social business and volunteering. Arun one day hopes to live somewhere warm, have a dog, and work as a brand manager. She has considered aspiring to take over the world, but her time commitment for now does not allow for it!

		<p>Born in Paris and educated at international schools in both France and the United Kingdom, Paul Moreau joins the secretariat this year with high school experience in both Model U.N. and European Parliament of Youth. While his double major in political science and economics supports his basic interest in Model U.N. and international affairs, Paul’s skill-set for the conference truly lies in his organizational capabilities; his vast high school and collegiate experience in event organization will culminate this summer in helping run the Economic Forum of the Americas, making him the ideal Chief of Operations for our conference in the fall.

A veteran at SSUNS (this will be his 6th conference!), the portfolio couldn’t have been placed in better hands. Be prepared for any twists and turns you may see in committee session for his roots ultimately lie as a Crisis Deputy. While most know him for his corny jokes and love of karaoke, most don’t know Ani’s amazing singing skills, which he showcases in a Bollywood-fusion a cappella group. One item on his bucket list is to own a husky, so if you want to win his seal of approval, you know what to do.

		<h3>Deputy USG Committees (General Assemblies and Economic and Social Council Councils)</h3>
		<p><a href="mailto:gaecosoc@ssuns.org">gaecosoc@ssuns.org</a></p>
		<p>Daniel was born in Guildford, England just outside of London and was raised in Guelph, Ontario. With a large attraction to the big-city life Montreal has to offer, and McGill’s challenging school environment, it was with no doubt that Daniel pursued his interests and enrolled in the university’s faculty of arts and science as a Cognitive Science major, and International Development and Italian Studies double minor. His role in Model United Nations roots from his initial involvement as a delegate in grade 9, with his high level of interest in politics driving him to further pursue his involvement in the group. As an avid musician with the ability to play the piano, clarinet, saxophone and violin, a trivia star with national recognition and a romantic comedy movie enthusiast, Daniel uses his free time in an exciting manner. He also appreciates consuming real, Italian pizza and reading his favourite book, “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime”. On a lighter note, Daniel thoroughly dislikes the colour yellow and is incapable of sleeping with socks on.

		<p>Having travelled to Kenya, Tokyo, Swaziland and all over Europe, this year’s Deputy USG Specialized Agencies is a real globetrotter. A true Canadian, Hilary Chu was born and brought up in Vancouver. Hilary is a first year student pursuing a double major in Political Science and Economics. A skilled pianist, she spends her free time playing the music of her favourite composers; Chopin, Debussy and Elgar. If she isn’t jamming out to classical music, you’ll probably find Hilary running up to Mont Royal or watching her favourite Disney movie Mulan. Along with all of these accomplishments, Hilary has been an active participant of Model UN conferences since High School where her first MUN experience was actually at SSUNS. Hilary is looking forward to making the specialized agencies very memorable by bringing her new and creative outlook to the Secretariat and she can’t wait to see what the delegates bring forth to the conference.

		<p>The SSUNS finances this year are in the capable hands of Paola Daniore. Now in her third year at McGill, Paola grew up in the beautiful city of Milan, Italy, before moving to USA at the age of 9. When not pursuing her major in chemical engineering or watching her favourite movie, "The Invention of Lying", for the umpteenth time, Paola likes to serenade her friends with her amazing guitar skills and fantasize about taking long walks on the beach and basking in the warm Italian Sun. She chose to study in Montreal for the diversity that it offers and the ability to meet many different people in one place. She loves the challenging environment McGill has to offer and when the going gets tough, she takes comfort in Italian food. Despite being a newcomer, Paola is already loving Model UN and is bursting with ideas to take SSUNS 2013 to new heights!

Majoring in software engineering, she holds a surprising talent; minoring in music and playing guitar, drums, singing and writing songs in her spare time. She has definitely caught the travel bug as she has been to over 16 countries, and daydreams in her engineering classes of returning to her favourite destination, Barcelona. Lucille breaks the stereotype of most computer programmers with her creative and fun personality, and even participated as a delegate at Harvard MUN Beijing conference. With her mad coding skills, SSUNS is definitely in good hands!
