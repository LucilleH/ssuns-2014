		<h2>Shiva Mazrouei-Seidani</h2>
		<h3>Staff Room Co-Coordinator</h3>
		<p>All the way from the far away city of ‘Torono”, Shiva is a third year student studying Political Science and Middle Eastern Studies.  Having realized at an early age her fear of needles and strong dislike of blood, Shiva gave up her dreams of becoming a pediatric surgeon, and found her passion in the United Nations and world Organizations. This will be Shiva’s third year at McMUN, having served previously as a committee director. Prior to McMUN, she took part in and chaired her high school MUN.</p>
		<p>When she isn’t advocating for the rights of women and children, she enjoys listening to a variety of music, requires coffee on a regular basis and finds herself making daily schedules that she believes she will one day actually follow.  Familiar with four languages and fluent in none, she hopes to refine her skills and combine them with her great love of travelling so that she will one day be able to feed her caffeine addiction in all corners of the world.</p>
		<p>She will be working hard this year as the staff room co-coordinator to efficiently print all resolutions, provide all necessary equipment to committees, and be prepared with Band-Aids for the inevitable paper cuts.</p>

		<h2>Haya Khoury</h2>
		<h3>Staff Room Co-Coordinator</h3>
		<p>Born and raised in Jordan, Haya was enticed by her intrigue in foreign places and cultures when she chose to come to McGill three years ago to pursue a major in Economics and a minor in Environment. Driven by her outgoing personality, Haya can be a difficult person to track down as she tries to spend any free time she gets exploring new places and trying new things. Fitting to her portfolio as staffroom coordinator, Haya has always been excited by being involved in the logistical aspects of Model UN conferences. She first became involved with Model UN in grade eleven as an opportunity to meet new people, but quickly became head organizer of her high school conference in her senior year. This is her second time as staff room coordinator, with the first one for SSUNS 2011. You will find Haya hidden behind the piles of equipment in the staff room. Haya can not wait for this year’s conference and is looking forward to meet you all.</p>

		<h3>Page Co-Coordinator</h3>
		<p>Neelum is a psychology and biology student in her fourth year. She is interested in pursuing a career in medicine, but has recently taken an interest in international relations and current affairs. Although she is relatively new to the Model UN world, she has thoroughly enjoyed the conferences she has been involved in so far. Last year, she participated in SSUNS and McMUN and her experiences at both these conferences inspired her to become more involved in the Model UN circuit. Neelum is also heavily involved in work with the humanitarian organization Right To Play and she is really excited that they will be the charity at McMUN this year. She is really looking forward to being Page Co-Coordinator at McMUN 2013 and she is thrilled to share this experience with all of you!</p>

		<h2>Peter Laing</h2>
		<h3>Page Co-Coordinator</h3>
		<p>Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, Peter made stops in Perth, Australia and London, England before completing his commonwealth tour and finally settling in the quiet town of Oakville, Ontario. An economics major in his third year at McGill, Peter had his first taste of the international realm after violating ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) regulation at the age of nine. The naive youngster forgot a souvenir Swiss Army knife in his pocket before boarding an international flight and was subsequently detained for 6 hours. After being told participating in Model United Nations would get him into university, Peter used his time in the brig to successfully land a spot in his high school’s Model United Nations club. An unforgettable experience at NAIMUN in Washington D.C. led Peter to fall in love with current events and become a self-described news junkie. Admittedly, opting to read his subscription to ESPN before that of The Economist, Peter is nevertheless ready to kick some MUN Djibouti. When he isn’t telling a bad joke, Peter can be found getting too intense in intramural volleyball, drinking green tea or enjoying the company of the abundance of awesome people that inhabit the island of Montreal.</p>
		<p>Speaking of exceptional individuals, Peter is excited to have the opportunity to work with such a talented and important group of pages this year. Being the lifeblood of the conference, Peter looks forward to working alongside the conference’s paging staff to ensure an amazing and jail free time for all at McMUN 2013.</p>

		<p>When not busy writing code or trying to understand how math works, Nick spends his time visiting bars throughout Montreal, reading books in coffee shops because he likes to come across as wise, and crying silently every Sunday when he watches his awful fantasy football team.</p>
		<p>This year he will undertake the position of Delegate Resource Center Co-Coordinator, where he looks to bring his enthusiasm and work ethic to making sure McMUN 2013 is the best model U.N. conference ever. He has worked in the DRC previously as part of the McMUN 2012 staff.</p>

		<p>As a result of her keen interest in international relations, issues of global concern and understanding the processes through which multinational consensus is achieved, her professional ambition is to pursue an internationally-based management career in government, with an NGO or in a multinational corporate environment.</p>
		<p>While she hopes that everyone will be able to understand her accent throughout the lead-up and duration of the conference, she cannot promise anything but will still endeavor to answer any questions anyone may have! She is very excited to be a part of Model UN 2013 in a city as fantastic as Montreal.</p>

		<h3>Opening Ceremonies and Closing Ceremonies Coordinator</h3>
		<p>Outgoing, funny, cuckoo, witty, adventurous, out of the box and sporty are only some of the words her friends use to describe her. Maeda Zia was born and brought up amongst the hustle and bustle of Karachi, Pakistan. After realizing her passion for management and business at a very young age, she decided to pursue a marketing major with a concentration in organizational behavior. Despite her inexperience in MUNs, it’s her eclectic personality along with her love for working with people that helped her become the Opening and Closing ceremony staff coordinator. Being only involved in societies and events in management up till now, she is very enthusiastic about working with people from other faculties and interests during this MUN experience. </p>
		<p>Beyond her academics, Maeda loves exploring new places, be it taking road trips to nearby cities or late night walks to Old Port, she is ever ready to try new things. Her uncanny knack for imitating people along with her beat boxing skills makes her different from the rest of the crowd. Maeda loves to sing, which would be a good thing if she only knew how to, so if you ever hear a tone deaf person singing down the aisles of Sheraton, you’ll know exactly who it is!</p>

		<h3>Photo Coordinator</h3>
		<p>Sam became interested in photography when his Aunt visited him when he was 11 years old, and brought with her a new DSLR camera. Sam immediately loved the camera and spent hours taking photos with it every day. Two years later, he bought his own camera and has been taking photos ever since. Sam is taking a double major in International Development and Poli Sci, and is planning on taking a minor in Marketing. Eventually he wants to combine his passion for politics and development with business, in a way that can help people throughout the world…which really means he has no idea what he will do with his life, but he is looking forward to it anyway! This past summer he travelled to El Salvador for 12 weeks where he was working with a NGO on a pilot project of Plastic Water Filters to provide clean drinking water to families. In his spare time Sam enjoys watching movies, eating chocolate, and has recently become addicted to Game of Thrones.</p>

		<p>Being an active part of the MUN society in her high school and home university, she chose to be part of McMUN due to her interest in foreign affairs, dialogue, and people.

		<p>I’m Matt, and I'm originally from Orange County, California (yes, that OC, don't laugh) and grew up on the Jersey shore, five minutes outside of Atlantic City (and now I know you're laughing.) I am a senior at McGill in Montreal studying finance with minors in microbiology and immunology, and am so excited to be your Events Team Leader for McMUN 2013! With me are my fellow co-coordinators Tess Pereira, Paul Moreau, and Shelby Levesque, and together we promise you'll have the best pub crawl you could have ever imagined! Between the four of us, we have dozens of successful events worth of experience (or maybe a better measure is number of kegs emptied, in which case we’re well into the hundreds), so you can imagine the madness that will come about from all of us working together. If drinking until you can't see straight isn't your style, though, not to worry - we're planning on having plenty of other options, all of which are discounted exclusively for McMUN delegates. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the pub crawl or any of our non-alcoholic events on Friday night, please feel free to email us at entertainment@mcmun.org or entertainment-tl@mcmun.org, and we’ll be more than happy to assist you.</p>

He is doing a double major in Economics and Political Science, and he just moved to Montreal from France where he is born and raised. He only recently became involved in McGill Student life. This is his second experience as staff for MUN but he already has attended two MUN conferences in Europe as a delegate, and organized similar events. Back in France, he was involved in many MUN-like organizations in which he always had a lot of fun. This involvement represented most of his free time in high school and made it the pleasurable experience he remembers. Now, it seems like history is going to repeat itself, as Paul is very excited to participate in even more McGill's Model United Nations. Since he arrived here in Montreal, he is trying to discover this awesome city and its reputed nightlife.

Although still technically a teenager, she has the mental age of 75 as she enjoys crosswords, knitting, peoplewatching, and of course, cats. She participated in MUN for the very first time as the Deputy Director of Public Relations for SSUNS 2012, and is both inspired and frightened by the wit and intelligence of Model UN delegates. Although Shelby comes from a small town, get her in a game of Never Have I Ever, and you will see a side of her that remains hidden most of the time (for the benefit of all).</p> 		<p>Shelby's not-so-secret obsession with all things Middle Eastern is apparent immediately when she'll either try to speak Arabic, offer you some baklava, or ask if you have any cute Arab friends. Her amazing ability to get herself into awkward situations in uncanny and she is so excited to be working with McMUN and her aim is to make your nights unforgettable (and not just in the hypothetical sense).</p>

		<h3>Editor-in-Chief, <em>The Ambassador</em></h3>
		<p>Kevin Coles is the Editor in Chief of The Ambassador, vowing to maintain its good-natured character and to inject it with some Onion-esque humor this year. On paper, Kevin is the quintessential 4th-year Economics student you love to hate, spending his working time in Hong Kong (and an impressive ten minutes in North Korea) and his upcoming leisure time parading around Morocco. Ladies and gentlemen, this man is living the dream but not without due labour, splitting all waking hours preparing to be a TA and following the federal Liberal leadership race. All this aside, Kevin has worked his way up from Paging to staffing the DRC at SSUNS and McMUN, favoring the latter no doubt. Entertain Kevin with some financial banter and don’t be afraid to pull an Aaron Sorkin and go all political – he’ll just eat it up.</p>

		<h3>Senior Editor, <em>The Ambassador</em></h3>
		<p>A second year student new to the Model UN circuit, Jonathan Craske is studying Accounting in the Desautels Faculty of Management at McGill.  Hailing from the Bloor West Village community in Toronto, Jonathan hopes to bring a familiar and exciting sense of pride in McMUN and Model UN as a whole by highlighting the sure-to-be fascinating developments at McMUN 2013. His thought-provoking writings for the Financial Markets section of The Bull & Bear, the Management Faculty’s official news source, have helped launch this U1 student into the position of Senior Editor for The Ambassador.</p>
		<p>Seldom seen sans suit and tie, this hard-working zenith of classiness is always open to new and innovative ideas.  If you would like to bribe him, please deliver a 2012 BMW M5 to The Centre Sheraton just before Opening Ceremonies. A proud Canadian, Jonathan’s hobbies include ice hockey, apologizing, red plaid flannel shirts, and self-deprecating humour.</p>
		<p>Jonathan’s inspirations include Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Bill Clinton, and Jeremy Clarkson: great men with great visions. The works of Clinton and Trudeau inspired Jonathan to follow politics intently throughout his life. His attention to detail will undoubtedly bolster the editorial quality McMUN participants have come to expect of The Ambassador. In addition to these achievements, Jonathan is currently training for an Ironman triathlon. Though he is new to Model UN, Jonathan is ready to hit the ground running come McMUN 2013 opening ceremonies!</p>
