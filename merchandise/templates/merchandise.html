<h1>Merchandise</h1>

<p>
To celebrate our 25th anniversary, we will not only be bringing you the largest
merchandise selection that has ever been offered at McMUN, but for the first
time ever, you can place your orders in advance! Worried that the famous McMUN
shot glass will be sold out before you get a chance to buy it? Or do you just
not want to have to wait in line for the new McMUN lapel pin? By placing an
online order now, we will have your merchandise ready for you to pick up. Also,
to encourage everyone to take full advantage of the online shop, we have reduced
our prices!
</p>

<p>
<em>Certain items may not be available at the conference and prices may
increase. All the prices listed below include taxes.</em>
</p>

<p>
Delegates will be able to place an order on merchandise after they have
registered and their registration has been approved by the Charg√©e d'Affaires.
The online shop will be open from August 1st 2013 to November 19th, 2013.
