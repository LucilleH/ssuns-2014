Dear Delegate,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the BRICS Summit. This committee will be
run by some of McGill’s finest and most experienced staffers. Moreover, with intense
background preparation and a unique delegate format (explained below) the BRICS
Summit is one of the most challenging and intensive committees offered at McMUN
2013\. On that note, Team Committees and the BRICS Summit dais encourage the most
experienced delegates to apply.

In the BRICS Summit, delegates will be working in teams comprised of the Head of
State, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Defence conjointly representing one of the
BRICS nations. These teams will be made up of delegates from the same educational
institute. As such, delegates are asked to apply in conjunction with two other delegates
from their respective university. Please note which other delegates you are applying with
in the application part of this form seen below. You will also find a questionnaire that
will allow us to prepare a more enjoyable and productive committee experience. It will
give us insight into the different skills that each interested applicant could bring to the
committee, with the goal of creating the most productive committee dynamic possible.
Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding the BRICS Summit at
this year’s McMUN.

Sincerely,

Abdaal Mazhar Shafi
