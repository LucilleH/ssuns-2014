Dear Delegate,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the Nixon Interviews. This committee will be
run by some of McGill’s finest and most experienced staffers as a joint crisis committee,
divided into Richard Nixon and Advisors, and David Frost and Researchers. Moreover,
with the special rules of procedure and unique set-up of this committee, the Nixon
Interviews promise to challenge delegates at an unprecedented level. On that note, Team
Committees and the dais encourage the most experienced delegates to apply.

Below you will find a questionnaire that will allow us to prepare a more enjoyable and
productive committee experience. It will also give us insight into the different skills that
each interested applicant could bring to the committee, with the goal of creating the most
productive committee dynamic possible. Please feel free to contact us if you have any
questions regarding the Nixon Interviews at this year’s McMUN.

Sincerely,
