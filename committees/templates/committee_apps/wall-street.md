Dear Delegate,

Thank you for your interest in joining the Wall Street 2008 committee. We are excited
to offer this specialised agency. Our goal is to recreate the exciting environment of the
financial crisis in 2008 with a McMUN twist. This simulation will be tough, will be
challenging, and, we hope, rewarding. If you have a passion for finance, economics, and
world politics, and a confidence with debate, we strongly encourage you apply for this
committee.

Please answer the questionnaire attached. By doing so, it provides insight into your
strengths and familiarity with the topics that will be debated in this simulation. As
always, please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.We look
forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Abdaal Mazhar Shafi
